<h1>About</h1>
<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:24px;line-height:1.4">
<q>
I am an energy data scientist leveraging Python to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system.
</q>
</p>
<p>To better understand the world and the energy supply system fundamentally, I studied physics at RWTH Aachen University. During my master's, I researched electrochemistry in France, manufacturing and analyzing batteries in the <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr">Collège de France</a>, Paris.</p>
<p>Back in Germany, I wrote my master thesis on the influence of weather patterns on energy system analysis and worked as a student employee in the team data science at <a href="https://www.digital-energysolutions.de/en/">Digital Energy Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I worked as a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/Home/home_node.html">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>, analyzing the influence of spatial aggregation on the computational complexity of energy system analysis.</p>
<p>Currently, I work as a software architect and data scientist at <a href="https://www.accure.net/">ACCURE Battery Intelligence GmbH</a>, a startup I co-founded in 2020.</p>
<p>Along my path, Python has proven to be my language of choice and I am constantly developing my skills, recently as a mentor of the <a href="https://pybit.es">PyBites Developer Mindset Program</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
